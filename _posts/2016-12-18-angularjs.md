title: building a single page app

======
**the project**
======

**requirements** >> build a single page AngularJS app with Rails backend.

**the app** >> gubbinal, an app to help you discover musicians' top three records and directors' top three films.

**the takeaway**
======

Before digging into Angular (and jQuery), it seemed like front-end design meant making something that was nice to look at. Now, I understand that it's more about making something that's nice to interact with.

It was incredible to see Angular bring HTML to life. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/anandmanisankar/L6nofag6/">This fiddle</a> - five brief lines of code that create a dynamic div - perfectly illustrates how powerful and efficient Angular is.
