"Facts are simple and facts are straight \\
Facts are lazy and facts are late \\
Facts all come with points of view \\
Facts don't do what I want them to."

   Talking Heads, "Crosseyed and Painless"

## the project {:#post-title}

**requirements** >> build a CLI, packaged as a gem, that scrapes data from an external source.

**what** >> domestic_goods, a gem to help navigate you toward american-made companies

**where** >> [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/domestic_goods) / [github](https://github.com/bennorris/domestic_goods-cli-gem)

**why** >> it's hard to find ethically-made goods, and it shouldn't be. i started the project hoping to scrape a directory of companies that manufacture ethically, but wasn't able to find the perfect source. so the idea slowly transitioned to an interactive list of american-made companies separated by category.

## the main takeaway

For me, one of the most enjoyable parts of learning to write and read code is the flexibility involved with making something work. There is a certain rigidity, of course---there are boundaries that will break your program every single time when crossed. But within those boundaries is a lot of freedom.      

I can feel when my own code is clumsy, can sense when it's getting the job done but doing so inelequently. The more time I spend reading others' code, the more I recognize the elegance of experience: like the ability to make something work in one line, rather than five (or, at the other end of the spectrum, the needlessly complex approaches that just obscure what they're up to).

The analogy with "Crosseyed and Painless" isn't perfect (but who needs an excuse to quote Talking Heads?). Code, like fact, is a slippery business that seems more inflexible than it is.

-Not naming the executable file within my bin the same thing as my gem. It seems like a good
