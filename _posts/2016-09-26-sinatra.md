======
**the project**
======

**requirements** >> build an MVC application using Sinatra that: 1. uses ActiveRecord to interact with a database 2. has multiple Models 3. includes user accounts

**what** >> tool tracker, an application that helps companies keep track of their equipment. employees can check out and return tools, view who has a checked out tool, and more.

**where** >> [github](https://github.com/bennorris/tool-tracker)

**why** >> the idea came from a conversation with an accountant at a construction company - she told me that lost and stolen tools are a huge problem for their business, and it would be helpful to have a simple system to track tools (there are already companies doing this, but from her description, they're either expensive, clunky, or a combination of the two). at the moment, there are some major limitations of tool tracker: it would be helpful to eventually allow admins to batch add employees and tools with a spreadsheet. it'd be ideal if employees received a signup link via email--rather than having to signup on their own--once the admin had added them to the company. and there are more than a few design issues (lack of responsive design = a major one). but it's a start.

======
**lessons learned**
======

-nothing breaks a path as easily as a forgotten slash\\
-there's less magic with sinatra than there is with rails, which means spending a lot more time doing things like: setting up routes, authentication, etc.\\
-it's insanely addictive to work on a project that 1. you're interested in and 2. seems potentially useful. the lessons on the learn.co platform are invaluable for guidance, but nothing compares to the learning that happens when you're actually building something.
