title: learning to code on learn.co

With graduation just one blog post away, I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experience with the Flatiron School's online campus, Learn.

I'll start with my path to Learn. When I became interested in programming, I started out with Codecademy. After completing the HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery sections - along with most of the Ruby and Python lessons - I was completely hooked. But a major limitation of the platform, for me at least, was that it felt like I was becoming dependent on writing code within the text editor they provide in the browser. I wanted to build projects, and I had the basic skills to start writing the code, but I had no knowledge of how to take those skills and apply them somewhere other than Codecademy's site. Sure, I probably could've continued along and used Stack Overflow to fill in the gaps, but I wanted a more holistic learning experience. At the advice of a coworker, my next stop was Free Code Camp. Using Free Code Camp helped me develop a much stronger grasp of JavaScript. I loved the focus on problem-solving, and it encouraged much deeper thinking than Codecademy did -- but it still felt like my learning was haphazard and needed some direction. So I started considering in-person, intensive bootcamps.

I spent weeks considering the different programs in New York, and eventually came up with a list of my top three choices:  App Academy, Flatiron School, and MakerSquare. I hadn't considered any online programs.

When I started preparing to apply to Flatiron School, I thought it'd be a good idea to go through the introductory Ruby curriculum on Learn. And I loved it. Their IDE, the way the lessons and labs were designed, the ability to learn at my own pace - it all just felt right (there are few things better than seeing that list of green Rspec tests you've just passed).     

But I still had hesitations. The program was really new, so would there be some kinks in the curriculum? And since it was fairly untried, would potential employers see Learn as legitimate? Would it be as effective to learn in my apartment, rather than in a classroom?

There were a lot of things that tipped me toward Learn, rather than an in-person intensive. Here are a few:

1. Cost. If cost wasn't an issue, the only consideration when choosing a program would be the quality of teaching, the strength of the curriculum, and the students you'd be surrounded by. But bootcamps are businesses, and they're expensive. There are tons of options to choose from - all of them dangling promises of impressive salaries in front of eager eyes - and they typically require <em>a lot</em> of money (significantly less than a college degree, sure. But $18k for three months, plus living expenses, is still, well, steep, to say the least). So the fact that I could learn the same, well-tried curriculum as the Flatiron School's in-person intensive at less than half the cost was very appealing. Which sort of brings me to the next consideration:

2. The emerging bootcamp business. I have no doubt that most people who attend coding bootcamps are passionate about programming. Learning to code takes a level of dedication that requires passion. But it's also not hard to imagine plenty of people lured by promises of a high salary. And bootcamps recognize that. My experience with the initial stages of an application at one program felt so coldly like a business transaction - and so little like the first steps toward an education - that it made me hesitate about the idea of a bootcamp at all. But then I Skyped with an admissions officer at the Flatiron School, and the experience was entirely different. He was warm and encouraging, and by the way he described the school, you could tell that it was a place that valued and was committed to its students. So if you're stuck trying to decide between a handful of different programs, my advice would be:  talk to someone at the program first. It's the quickest way to get a feel for the culture there (& of course it's good to read as many reviews as possible from previous students , too).  

3. Learning style. Learn is definitely not right for everyone's learning style. If you thrive on classroom interaction and need set deadlines to stay motivated, an in-person immersive may be a better choice. But if you're an independent learner, like to move at your own pace, and don't mind spending long stretches figuring things out on your own, Learn is the perfect option. There are Learn experts that can offer a hand any time you have a question, along with a community-based Q&A feature, so it never feels like you're on your own if you get stuck. They've even introduced 'Friends' and a Learn Verified chat forum, so you're able to communicate as much or as little with your fellow students as you want.

4. Flexibility. Using Learn meant that I could work at either a sprint or a jog. It didn't matter if I was in New York or Helsinki, at a coffee shop or at my kitchen table. For things that I had already covered, like JavaScript, I could move quickly. But for other sections, like Rails, I could take my time to make sure I thoroughly understood the material before moving on.

As I look back on my experience using the Learn platform, I'm extremely glad that I chose the route I did.

There were moments of frustration - like a few labs with a bunch of tedious tests that had little to do with the lessons they were supposed to reinforce - but these moments were the exception, and every learning experience comes with frustration.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Learn. And if you want to hear something more specific about the program, feel free to shoot me an email at bennorris07@gmail.com.

If you're on the fence about learning to code, I can't say it any better than Tom Waits:
